# Analyzing-Yelp-reviews-using-NLP-techniques
In this project, Yelp restaurant reviews were analysed to gain business insights using NLP techniques. Out of 6.6 million reviews, we selected only Ontario restaurants with more than 300 reviews. We divided the 1-2-star reviews as negative reviews, 3-star reviews as average review and 4-5-star reviews as positive reviews. After removing stop words and performing TF-IDF, various topic modelling approaches were used to find out relative positive, average and negative weight of topics for different restaurants. The results obtained were visualized using Cognos BI [1]. Moreover, we also compared the running time complexity for topic modelling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF). These insights would help the business owners to improve their services.
